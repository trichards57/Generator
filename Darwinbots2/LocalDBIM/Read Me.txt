ONLY use this program if you have NO INTERNET ACCESS.
You will have to move it to your main DB folder.
Make sure you make a backup of the program in your main DB folder first in case you want to use it later.

If you DO HAVE Internet Access and still would like to link more than one local instance of Darwinbots together: 

Method 1:
Make sure you have unique user name for each instance.

Method 2:
You can setup portals in all your instances that link to the common in/out folders.
This method is less resource intensive as robots will not be transferred trough the internet.
