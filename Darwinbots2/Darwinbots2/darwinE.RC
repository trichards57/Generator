16001 "All the circels you see in these pictures are robots, that means they're program controlled machines. Every robot has senses and actuators to interact with the environment."
16002 "The controlling program is called DNA; it works on a memory fed with data coming from senses; some memory locations also are bound to actuators."
16003 "Every robot needs energy, to perform actions and execute DNA. Here you can see an orange robot shooting at a green one, forcing it to emit white particles, carrying energy. The result is an energy transfer from green to orange bot. "
16004 "A robot is duplicating. In this operation his DNA is copied in a newly formed 'robot body'. You can see a thick string tieing parent and child for a while "
16005 "Robots can connect to each other with thin, but everlasting ties. Here you can see a multicellular worm made up of four cells tied together in a precise shape."
16006 "Robots can use ties also to send information or energy, and also move them to swim, as these worms do."
16007 "This is a scheme for the robot sense of sight: it is a one-dimensional projection of a 30 degree field portion. Nine receptors return the distance of the nearest object in their sector."
